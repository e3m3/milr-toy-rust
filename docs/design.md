#   Rust source (`src/`)

The Rust source implements a frontend for generation of the MLIR assembly.

The frontend is also responsible for driving the optimization pipeline and calling the appropriate
backend lowering passes.


#   MLIR source (`mlir/`)

The AST/MLIR assembly is to be parsed by the autogenerated MLIR tablegen modules in preparation
for further processing.

The MLIR source contains the definitions for the optimization driver (`opt-mlp`), as well as the
registration of the MLIR dialect (`dialect-mlp.{h,td}`) and its operations (`ops-mlp.{h,td}`).

The implementation boilerplate here is currently modeled after the MLIR repository toy example [[1]],
and the MLIR standalone dialect template [[2]] until a more complex example can be constructed.


#   Workflow

*   `build.rs`:

    The build script drives the compilation of the tablegen and C++ components of the MLIR dialect.
    This script roughly follows the structure of the CMake components required for building a MLIR
    dialect standalone, but does so by calling the downstream tools directly without introducing
    CMake as a dependency.

    The current challenge is to interop the Rust frontend AST with the tablegen infrastructure for 
    driving optimizations on the language operations.
    
    *   The naive solution is to reimplement the AST and parser within C++ for interop, leveraging
        tablegen defined builder operations as specified in the MLIR tutorial/examples.
        The downside of this is that the AST and parsing infrastructure will be duplicated in both
        Rust and C++ separately, which will be a source of bugs and wasted developer time.
        Requiring a C++ parser obviates the Rust frontend.
        However, the Rust frontend provides a smoother developer experience through higher level
        abstractions and improved compiler interactions with the developer.
        I would prefer to work with a Rust frontend.

    *   Is there a generic adaptor for the AST which can be included from the tablegen definition?
        The `dialect-mlp.h.inc` header automatically generates an explicit prototype for the
        construction of the dialect instance given a MLIR context.
        The definition of this constructor is currently missing during build.

        ```
        clang++ stderr:
        Undefined symbols for architecture arm64:
          "mlir::mlp::MlpDialect::MlpDialect(mlir::MLIRContext*)", referenced from:
              mlir::mlp::MlpDialect* mlir::MLIRContext::getOrLoadDialect<mlir::mlp::MlpDialect>()::'lambda'()::operator()() const in opt-mlp-676c67.o
          "mlir::detail::TypeIDResolver<mlir::mlp::MlpDialect, void>::id", referenced from:
              mlir::detail::TypeIDResolver<mlir::mlp::MlpDialect, void>::resolveTypeID() in opt-mlp-676c67.o
        ```

    *   From the MLIR FAQ, there is a claim that a frontend does not need to register a dialect
        directly [[1]]:

            Finally, dialects can be registered with the context.
            The sole purpose of the registration is to make these dialects available for the textual
            parser used by tools like mlir-opt or mlir-translate.
            A compiler frontend emitting the IR programmatically and invoking a pass pipeline would
            never need to register any dialects.

        However, my understanding is that the pass pipeline is driven by the `opt` tool which is
        stated to depend on the textual parser which expects dialect registration with the context.

    *   Does using the MLIR C API mitigate this issue (i.e., using the mlir-sys package directly)?
        Or will this require extra effort avoided by using the tablegen autogeneration?
